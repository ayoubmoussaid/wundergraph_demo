# WunderGraph Demo project

This project is a simple Todo list (Trello style) using Wundergraph, Next.js, Prisma, Graphql, Typescript and PostgreSQL.


## Getting Started

Install the dependencies and run the complete demo project in one command (make sure you have docker installed and running):

```shell
npm install && npm start
```

After a while, a new browser tab will open,
and you can start exploring the application.
If no tab is open, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Running WunderGraph will automatically introspect the database and generate an API.

## Cleanup

```shell
npm run cleanup
```
